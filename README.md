# Disaster Response Classification

This repo explores classification of text using machine learning into 35 classes

This model predicts the classification of a given typical disaster emergency response text message. For example, if the input is: "My house is flooding", the classification category should be "Flood". This application is useful to identify emergency response services required.


### Future Work

* The model can be hosted as a webapp
* The module can be extended to include speech-to-text and predicting on top of it
